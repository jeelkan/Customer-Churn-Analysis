## **Introduction**  
Customer retention is crucial in today's competitive business environment. This project focuses on churn analysis, a technique used to identify customer attrition patterns and predict potential churners. By leveraging **SQL Server, Power BI, and Machine Learning**, we aim to analyze customer behavior, uncover churn reasons, and implement predictive modeling to enhance customer retention strategies.

## **Project Overview**  

### **Objective**  
The goal of this project is to:  
- Build an ETL process to store and manage customer data efficiently.  
- Develop a Power BI dashboard to visualize customer insights.  
- Train a Random Forest model to predict future churners.  

### **Target Audience**  
This analysis is designed for **telecom companies**, but the methodologies and insights apply across industries like **finance, retail, and healthcare**, where customer retention is a priority.
